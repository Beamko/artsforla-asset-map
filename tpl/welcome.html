    <h1>Welcome to CAM</h1>
    <h2>Cultural Asset Map</h2>
    <p>
    CAM is an organic mapping project that identifies cultural resources along LA's Metro lines, municipal and school district boundaries. We built this tool to identify, connect and grow cultural resources throughout each of the 88 cities and 81 school districts that comprise Los Angeles County. The prototype launched in October 2013 with 1,000 sites recorded. It is our goal to expand this number exponentially through intentional community outreach and crowd sourcing. Please take a moment to test the prototype. It is a functional database that will allow users to sort criteria using an array of filters including organization size, type discipline as well as, geographic, metro line and municipal boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
    The depth and breadth of cultural activity exists on many layers and success of this project relies on contributed content. We hope to capture multiple layers of our regions expansive cultural ecology especially traditional, informal, community-based, spiritual, geographically as well as culturally diverse centers of creative expression.
